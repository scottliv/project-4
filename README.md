# Inhabitent 

A website built using wordpress as a content management system, with a custom theme and functionality.

## Technologies
PHP, Wordpress, CSS3, HTML 5, gulp

## Learning

In this project I learned how to make a larger scale website using wordpress as a content management system. I learned how to use php to generate content templates for a custom wordpress theme. I learned about creating custom post types and taxonomies by creating a functionality plugin that would allow me to customize a website that would be easily catered to a client's needs and keep the content independant of the theme.
Working on a larger project taught me the value of sass and writing reusable styles and templates.

## Acknowlegments

This theme was built on a red academy starter theme similar to _s (https://underscores.me/)
